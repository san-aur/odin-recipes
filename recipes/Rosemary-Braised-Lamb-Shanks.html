    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lamb shanks braised in red wine with fresh rosemary, garlic, and tomatoes. Excellent served with polenta or roasted garlic mashed potatoes, my family's favorite, to soak up the wonderful sauce.</p>

    <p>This is a fantastic dish to make for company, as all the prep work is done at the beginning. All you have to do is wait.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Lamb shanks: This recipe makes six lamb shanks. If you have more or less, you’ll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Lamb shanks are seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Cook the lamb shanks in olive oil until they are brown on all sides before you cook them with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You’ll need onions, carrots, and canned whole peeled tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Red wine: You don’t need to use your most expensive bottle, but make sure to use a wine you wouldn’t mind sipping.</li>
        <li>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade beef broth and chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
